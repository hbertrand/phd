\section{Deformable shape models and deep learning}

We propose in this section to train a neural network to predict the deformation required for a shape model to match a specific segmentation target on a specific image. There are three components: learning a global transformation

\subsection{Learning a global transformation}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \theta_{0, 0} & \theta_{0, 1} & \theta_{0, 2} & \theta_{0, 3} \\
    \theta_{1, 0} & \theta_{1, 1} & \theta_{1, 2} & \theta_{1, 3} \\
    \theta_{2, 0} & \theta_{2, 1} & \theta_{2, 2} & \theta_{2, 3} \\ 
    \theta_{3, 0} & \theta_{3, 1} & \theta_{3, 2} & \theta_{3, 3} 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
